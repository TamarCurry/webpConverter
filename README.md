# webpConverter

Because we all hate when we download an image only to discover it's in WEBP format...

Converts WEBP files to JPG or PNG

You can use the Python files directly to convert through the command line.

Or you can download either of the .exe files and then associate the file type with the program. This will automatically convert the .webp file when you double click it.
